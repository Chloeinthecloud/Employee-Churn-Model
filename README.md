# Employee-Churn-Model: a HR Analytics Case Study
Employee churn is a costly problem for companies, and the true cost of replacing an employee can often be quite large. This is due to the amount of time spent to interview and find a replacement, sign-on bonuses, and the loss of productivity for several months while the new employee gets accustomed to the new role.

In this project, I will attempt to solve the following problems:

* What is the likelihood of an active employee leaving the company?
* What are the key indicators of an employee leaving the company?
* What policies or strategies can be adopted based on the results to improve employee retention?

## Data Description
In this project, a HR dataset was sourced from IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance which contains employee data for 1,470 employees with various information about the employees. I will use this dataset to predict when employees are going to quit by understanding the main drivers of employee churn.
